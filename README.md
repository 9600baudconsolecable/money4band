<img src="./.resources/.assets/M4B_logo_small.png?raw=true" width="96"> - **Leave a star ‚≠ê if you like this project üôÇ thank you.**

**|Easy automatic multi app passive income project with Webdasboard, Auto Updater and Proxy Support:dollar::satisfied::+1:|**

## Quick Overview üöÄ
**Money4Band** leverages unused internet bandwidth allowing you to make money with something you have and would otherwise be wasted.** It utilizes containerized version of apps like EarnApp, Honeygain, IPRoyal Pawns, PacketStream, Peer2Profit, Repocket, Earnfm, Proxyrack, Proxylite, Bitping and so on but it's also safer than installing and using these native apps on your host system.

‚ú® **Key Features:**
- **Multiplatform** and lightweight docker stack.
- **Automatic Updates** to keep your applications up-to-date.
- **Web Dashboard** for easy monitoring.
- **Proxy Support** for enhanced flexibility.

üåê For a detailed overview and FAQ, visit the [Wiki](https://github.com/MRColorR/money4band/wiki) or join our [Discord Community](#-join-the-money4band-community-on-discord).

## Getting Started üö•
### Prerequisites
- Ensure that you have a 64-bit operating system, virtualization functions are enabled and Docker is installed and able to auto start up on system boot.
- (Optional) For ARM devices like Raspberry Pi, installing an emulation layer for non-ARM native Docker images is recommended. Even though the script can assist with the installation, we recommend users to install an emulation layer by themselves following the [Wiki](https://github.com/MRColorR/money4band/wiki) guide.
- (Optional) On Windows, ensure the Virtualization platform and Windows Subsystem for Linux are active as Docker requires these features. Even though the script can assist with the installation, we recommend users to enable these windows functions by themselves following the [Wiki](https://github.com/MRColorR/money4band/wiki) guide.
